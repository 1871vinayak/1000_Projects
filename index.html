<p>Before committing make sure you follow all the instructions properly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blocked Port By-Pass Application</strong>: Apart from HTTP/HTTPS, all other ports are blocked. Our College LAN does not allow port 22 (SSH Port). Therefore, develop a tool that bypasses blocked port 22.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Network Protocol</strong>: UDP and TCP protocols have few problems/short-comings. Identify them and design your own Network Protocol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TOR</strong>: TOR is a very famous applications used in college/university by students for tunneling websites. Most of the college internet providers have even blocked TOR. So, build similar  application for tunneling and defend yourself against network surveillance and traffic analysis. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chat Application using AJAX</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lan Audio(Voice) Chat</strong>: Can be easily implemented in Java with Java-net and Java Sample Audio API.</p></li>

So, write a simple brute force program to generate permutations (possible passwords) and send it to command line, creating and running shell script. Run until you receive a success return call, that's it, the simple Zip Password Cracker Project is ready.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create a Trojan Horse in C</strong>: Again that's pretty easy. Run a simple C++ program on remote computer. Intelligently create a huge .dll file in SYS 32 directory and as an impact, eat the hard-disk space of victim's computer. Any Clean up software ignore .dll file, so the only solution is: Victims have to reformat the hard drive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simple C++ Key Logger Project</strong> : A project that records the key strokes of PC and store it in intelligent way. Again, that can be easily done with Microsoft visual C++ SetWindowsHookEx  API. The premiere challenge is you have to be smart enough to outplay Anti-Virus in detecting your key-logger.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3D Bounce in OpenGL</strong>: Small game project, can be easily done with OpenGL-API for rendering  2D and 3D computer graphics.</p></li>

They then take turns firing at one another by guessing one of the board squares. If the square they guess contains part of a ship, it is a hit. Otherwise it is a miss. They sink a ship when all squares containing that particular ship have been uncovered. The player wins when all their opponents’ ships have been sunk.</p>

<p><strong>Chess and Checkers</strong> – Simply put a game of chess or checkers. Try to make it playable online and if you can use a graphical user interface that can also undo or redo a step as well as keep a history of moves for replay.</p>

<p><strong>Hangman</strong> – Randomly select a word from a file, have the user guess characters in the word. For each character they guess that is not in the word, have it draw another part of a man hanging in a noose. If the picture is completed before they guess all the characters, they lose.</p>

<p><strong>Crossword Puzzle</strong> – Create a crossword puzzle which links words together on common letters. Provide a list of clues for each word and let the user enter fill in the words until the entire crossword is filled in.</p>

<p><strong>Frogger</strong> – Get your frog across the river and lanes of traffic by either jumping on logs and lily pads rushing by at different speeds or avoid the automobiles which are also moving at various speeds. Based on the old arcade game..</p>
