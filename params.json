","body":"# 1000_Projects\r\n Mega List of practical projects that any one can solve in any programming language!\r\n \r\n[Contributing](https://github.com/vicky002/1000_Projects/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n============\r\nSee ways of contributing to this repo. You can contribute solutions (will be published in this repo) to existing problems, add new projects or remove existing ones. Make sure you follow all instructions properly.\r\n\r\n[Solutions](https://github.com/vicky002/Project_Solutions/blob/master/README.md)\r\n==========\r\n\r\nYou can find implementations of these projects in many other languages by other users in [this repo](https://github.com/vicky002/Project_Solutions).\r\n\r\nBefore committing make sure you follow all the instructions properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Blocked Port By-Pass Application**: Apart from HTTP/HTTPS, all other ports are blocked. Our College LAN does not allow port 22 (SSH Port). Therefore, develop a tool that bypasses blocked port 22.\r\n\r\n- **New Network Protocol**: UDP and TCP protocols have few problems/short-comings. Identify them and design your own Network Protocol.\r\n\r\n- **TOR**: TOR is a very famous applications used in college/university by students for tunneling websites. Most of the college internet providers have even blocked TOR. So, build similar  application for tunneling and defend yourself against network surveillance and traffic analysis. \r\n\r\n- **Chat Application using AJAX**\r\n\r\n- **Lan Audio(Voice) Chat**: Can be easily implemented in Java with Java-net and Java Sample Audio API.\r\n\r\n- **Group Chat in Java**: Again it's easy to implement. A basic knowledge of Concurrent Server will do.\r\n\r\n- **Media Player in Java**:  Easy to implement. Thanks to Java Sample Sound/Audio API.\r\n\r\n- **MP3 Extractor from you-Tube**\r\n\r\n-  **Text Editor:** Designing UI for text editor with Java Swing is a cake walk. Use an advanced data structure like suffix tree, Patrica ,etc for searching.\r\n\r\n- **Zip Password Crackers**: Any File Can be unzipped through the command line, providing password as an argument. So, write a simple brute force program to generate permutations (possible passwords) and send it to command line, creating and running shell script. Run until you receive a success return call, that's it, the simple Zip Password Cracker Project is ready.\r\n\r\n- **Create a Trojan Horse in C**: Again that's pretty easy. Run a simple C++ program on remote computer. Intelligently create a huge .dll file in SYS 32 directory and as an impact, eat the hard-disk space of victim's computer. Any Clean up software ignore .dll file, so the only solution is: Victims have to reformat the hard drive.\r\n\r\n- **Simple C++ Key Logger Project** : A project that records the key strokes of PC and store it in intelligent way. Again, that can be easily done with Microsoft visual C++ SetWindowsHookEx  API.

Lot of frame work and tools are available. Good project for PHP, AJAX and J2EE Expert.\r\n\r\n- **Online Test Management**: Similar to  interviewstreet.com    Can be easily done in PHP or any server side scripting Language. \r\n\r\n- **CMS**: Develop a CMS similar to Joomla, Drupal,etc. Students of  National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli developed a CMS named Pragyan. They use this project for maintaining college web-site as well as Tech-Fest Website. \r\n\r\n- **Discussion Forum**: Develop something like http://www.quora.com/, Stack Overflow , DISQUS \r\n \r\n- **Intranet File Search Engine**:\r\n\r\n- **A Social Code Sharing Site**: Build a user-driven application with much more interactivity and some social-style features—specifically, a community-based repository of useful, reusable code.Something like Django snippets. This project can be easily done in Django (web framework).\r\n\r\n- **Highly Confidential Security System**:Develop an application for storing file, images , audio , video ,etc. in a secure way. Use an advance and almost non- crack-able cipher(Blowfish, AES, etc.) to encrypt data(text data & media-file) before caching them in a password protected locker.\r\n\r\n- **Defect Tracking Tool** : Develop and application to track defects in different product and implement various defects and their analysis.\r\n\r\n- **Search tool based on data-mining algorithm**: When you type the first letter in facebook search box, have you ever  noticed, the friend name whom you search frequently or with whom you interact mostly  in fb appears on the top of the suggestion box. That's because of highly efficient data-mining algorithm implemented by facebook. Develop similar tool and add few additional as well as custom features.\r\n\r\n- **Classifier**: Most of the existing classifiers  are not quite accurate.
